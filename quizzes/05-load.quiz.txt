1. What is the purpose of the 'Text::CSV::getline_hr()' method?

2. Inside the 'while' loop in this program, we use three perl builtin
functions:  'join', 'delete' and 'exists'.  Explain what each does.

3. Explain what is going on in this use of the Perl builtin 'sort' function:

    sort {
        (
            ($data{$b}{'2014_murder_rate'} || 0)
            <=>
            ($data{$a}{'2014_murder_rate'} || 0)
        )
        ||
        $a cmp $b
    } keys %data
