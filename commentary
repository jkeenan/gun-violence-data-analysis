When we examine the output of the first draft of our program, we observe some
problems with the data.

1. In each row there are many columns lacking data.

2. The header row has one less column than all other rows.

3. There is one row where two columns have data in an anomalous format.  The
reason for these anomalies is discussed in the guardian notes file.

4. There are several rows where the '2014_tract_population' is listed as '0',
which in turn means that for other columns you get a division-by-zero error.

We can address these problems in the second draft of our program by (a) only
retrieving the 10 columns which have an entry in the header row; and (b)
skipping records where the 2014_tract_population is listed as 0.
